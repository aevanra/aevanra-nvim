I started using Regolith as my first WM, but I have since realized that everything that I am enjoying about Regolith is 
coming from i3, but working with it is more difficult than i3, largely because the config locations are different for i3
i3 running within Regolith than just i3 running on its own. I will likely transition all of these Regolith configs to a 
standalone i3 instead soon. I think Regolith has some nice features and is a very approachable entry point to window 
managers, but I felt that I outgrew it rather quickly -- primarily trying to do more customizations becomes tricky when
config files are not where you owuld otherwise expect them to be.
